# Tuple Types

---

The same as [Primitive Types](/docs/primitive-types) and [Object Types](/docs/primitive-types), Hegel provides support for usage array literal as type, and this array literal types called Tuples. Tuple types allow you to define an array with a fixed number of elements with known types. The syntax fo tuple types is `[type1, type2, type3]`.

```typescript
const tuple: [string, number] = ["", 0];
```

## Getting element from Tuple

Unlike [Array Types](/docs/array-types) Tuple will return strict type which is placed at position in tuple type definition and will show an error, if you try to access out of tuple range.

```typescript
const tuple: [string, number] = ["", 0];

// first type is "string"
const first = tuple[0];

// second type is "number"
const second = tuple[1];

// Error: Property "2" does not exist in "[string, number]"
const third = tuple[2];
```

Also, unlike [Array Types](/docs/array-types), Tuples have strict defined type for length and as result they cannot mutate "length" property in a tuple type.

```typescript
const tuple: [string, number] = ["", 0];

// length type is "2"
const length = tuple.length;

// Error: Type "3" is incompatible with type "2"
tuple.length = 3;
```

## Tuple methods and mutation

As you may understand, Hegel provides the same methods for Tuples Types as for [Array Types](/docs/array-types), but with one exception. If you try to use any of methods from Array which will mutate source tuple (https://doesitmutate.xyz/) you will have an error.

```typescript
const numbers: [number, number, number] = [1, 2, 3];
const plusOne = numbers.map((a) => a + 1);
const lessThan3 = numbers.filter((a) => a < 3);

// Error: Property "reverse" does not exist in "[number, number, number]"
const reversed = numbers.reverse();
```

## Subtyping

The same as [Array Types](/docs/array-types) Tuple types have invariant nature, so you can't assign to one tuple another with wider element type or with greater or less elements count.

```typescript
const source: [number, number] = [0, 0];

// Error: Type "[number, number]" is incompatible with type "[number | string, number]"
const widerByElementType: [number | string, number] = source;

// Error: Type "[number, number]" is incompatible with type "[number, number, number]"
const widerByElementsCount: [number, number, number] = source;

// Error: Type "[number, number]" is incompatible with type "[number]"
const narrowerByElementsCount: [number] = source;
```

And also tuples donâ€™t match array types:

```typescript
const source: [number, number] = [0, 0];

// Error: Type "[number, number]" is incompatible with type "Array<number>"
const array: Array<number> = source;
```
