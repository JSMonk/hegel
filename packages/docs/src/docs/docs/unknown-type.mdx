# Unknown Type
---------------------

Sometimes you don't know which type will come as function argument/variable value/object property value.
As example [`JSON.parse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse). This function can return array of any types, object with any properties or any valid JSON value like string, number, boolean and etc.

```typescript
const anything = JSON.parse('{ "name": null }');
```

The most general type in Hegel is `unknown`. You can imagine this type as ["Universal Set"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_set). It means that all possible values in JavaScript has `unknown` type. It's a supertype for all types in Hegel type system.

```typescript
const anyNumber: unknown = 2;
const anyString: unknown = "something";
const anything: unknown = class User {};
```

> If you already familiar with TypeScript or Flow.js, this type has the same semantic as `unknown` in TS or `mixed` in Flow.js

But, as you can understand, you can assign concrete type to wider type, but you can't assign wider type to a concrete type.

```typescript
const concreteType: string = "I'm good for unknown";
const wideType: unknown = "I'm too wide for string";

const iCanBeUnknown: unknown = concreteType;
const andICanBeString: string = concreteType;

const andICanBeUnknownToo: unknown = wideType;
const butCantBeString: string = wideType;
```

Also, it means that you can't use unknown type as an argument for function which is waiting for some concrete type:

```typescript
function waitingFor(value: string) {
  return `Awesome ${value}`;
}

const anything: unknown = 4;

// Error: Type "unknown" is incompatible with type "string"
waitingFor(anything);
```

Or operator:

```typescript
function waitingFor(value: unknown) {

  // Error: Type "unknown" is incompatible with type "string"
  return `Awesome ${value}`;
}

waitingFor(class User {});
```

> Actually, Hegel provides ability to [refine type](/docs/type-refinement).
