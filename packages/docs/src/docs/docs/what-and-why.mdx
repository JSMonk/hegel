## What is Hegel?

Hegel is a static type checker for JavaScript. It means that it is not a new language which compiles to JavaScript. No, it's only a tool which analyzes your code ahead of time and shows you results of the analysis. Also, it means that you don't need to learn a new language to use a static strong type system - JavaScript is enough. But, additionally, this tool provides a type syntax for your variable and function arguments, analysis of your types (even if you don't use type syntax), which gives you an ability to find bugs faster without actually running your program.

```typescript
// Example from real life ðŸ˜­
class DataBase {
  reconnect() {
    /* ... reconnect logic */
  }
  dropDatabase() {}
}
class Fixture {
  reconnect() {
    this.dropDatabase(); /* ... reconnect logic */
  }
  dropDatabase() {}
}

function setupE2E(db) {
  db.reconnect();
}

// And your teammate forgot to change something after debugging
const db = new Fixture();
debugger;
setupE2E(db);
// Congratulations, you became a DropDatabase Engineer
```

But if you have added only one thing in your code with Hegel, you would not have dropped the DataBase.

```typescript
// ...
function setupE2E(db: DataBase) {
// ...
```

You can see result in [Hegel Playground](/try#MYGwhgzhAEAiYBcwCFIFNoG8BQ1oCc1gB7AO1KIQAoBKLAtBAV31OgQAsBLCAbgHoAVNAB0YhiXKVoIYgHMuwaIP4BfbOtCQYAMS4APZoSy4JZCsGp1M7bhBEATfMQAO8JACN0tXgyNtOHgFhMREzKUsZeUVlNVMnV3cwLwg0Wix1dWwAMyZSSy4yaFTmFwBRACYyqgcPAC44RBR0a3iPEUJJCyteDWxsfn5oAEFSB2gAT2IWdjQwAFtEDGzifDliBHZiaGAOMFI5DAhiecZuA+gwbIQ0fGgHNA8mOQUD7EkITdroAF5oCgA7tA9IYWGkaL0Hk8XrdeoMRmNJtNoHsAG4YYYAeQAKtBbs47lw2FMZmgHFwEKtoFSifcWIhCmxiNloC5nAAraQkeYuLjgBCM7AlJjlKo1DwQ7BAA) - you would be notified before the incedent.

## Why Hegel?

First of all, let's explore the main goals of Hegel:

- Minimalistic type syntax
- Strong type system
- Powerful type inference

But we need to answer this question differently for different audiences. So, choose list item which describes your experience:

- [You have never worked with typed languages or type checkers](#why-actually-do-we-need-static-analysis)
- [You work with TypeScript](#benefits-and-disadvantages-over-typescript)
- [You work with Flow.js](#benefits-and-disadvantages-over-flowjs)

## Why actually do we need static analysis?

First of all, static analysis means that your code will be analyzed without actually running. So, static type analysis will analyze your code for any type of errors.

Actually, there are 2 major benefits of static type analysis:

1. Static type analysis finds and provides to you information about a type error that exists in your code during code writing. It not only gives you guarantees that your code will work without runtime type errors but in addition, it really saves a lot of time for finding and fixing errors, especially in big projects that contain a really long build step.
2. When you use an instrument that provides type information of your variables, functions, methods, classes and etc - you have got a documentation of method usage without any additional efforts.

```typescript
function deserializeUser(stringifiedUserJson) {
  const maybeUser = JSON.parse(stringifiedUserJson);
  if (
    typeof maybeUser === "object" &&
    maybeUser !== null &&
    "name" in maybeUser &&
    typeof maybeUser.name === "string"
  ) {
    return maybeUser;
  }
  throw new TypeError("Provided serialized user is invalid!");
}

const user = deserializeUser("42");
```

If you open this example in [Hegel Playground](/try#GYVwdgxgLglg9mABAEwKYGdUCcYEMA2MAXqgKqZYAU6UOYA5jMDKsudgFLoICUiA3gChEiCAhqIAtrgCeAIzIVEAXkQcAygHkAcgDoADriyZqtGAyYs2FLrwDcwxE0SVHIqDP2o4wKbIXsWCrKqgBEcHIAVqjQoYgAZPFufvKK2IgAhCGIYCD4+AlJIiKhYLiSqHHmKQFKickeXj41aVi6ZRXBYTR09KGOfELFiFioUCBYSNKpgQ4iAL6OUAAWWHAA7jmomwAqnqgAolhrVKEACmsAbjBoyIgUeIQkdyBKMOhOYJcENxmhPA5FoI0A8fiRApRQgAWABM-zsQA) and hover at `deserializeUser` function invocation, then you will see arguments types of the function, return type of the function and which error this function may throw. And you've got it free.

## Benefits and disadvantages over TypeScript

If you familiar with TypeScript you may know benefits of static typing, so let's explore benefits and disadvantages of Hegel over TypeScript

### Benefits

1. Ability to skip type annotation

Hegel is targeting at really powerful type inference which gives an ability to write less type annotations. As example:

```typescript
// Type of "promisify" function is "<_q, _c>((_c) => _q) => (_c) => Promise<_q>"
const promisify = (fn) => (arg) => Promise.resolve(fn(arg));

// Type of "id" function is "<_c>(_c) => Promise<_c>"
const id = promisify((x) => x);

// Type of "result" variable is "Promise<number>"
const result = id(42).then((x) => x + x);
```

> The same example in TypeScript (tested at version 3.7.5) will show 3 errors and inference `Promise<any>` type for "result" variable [TypeScript Example](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html?ssl=1&ssc=1&pln=7&pc=1#code/PTAEBUE8AcFNQPYDNQCJoCcEFsCWBnXJSVUJAVwDsBjAF1wUtALQB4BHAcgBpRrOAfAAoh-AJSgAvANBcJ00KM7yZABSx58sDoNQAoao3y1QmHASKQpZJgoCGGAOZS1GgrAB0GWPgQAbADdYISRKIQdHMTEAbj09EAgYeGQ0XAATUgoaekZmfDZ+YXEXUHVzLVZC-UNKY2Y06zNNSyEADxLWmLiEqDhEFFRvfHI-WlIAh1w7ACM-eBZUMs1tSnJsadgMAWqjEyGRk0l6oQAWACYxD1oAC1gw9oV2gGpQTujQIA).

2. No unexpected runtime errors

One of the non-goals of TypeScript is: "Apply a sound or "provably correct" type system. Instead, strike a balance between correctness and productivity.". It means that TypeScript never will guarantee that you will not have a Type Error at Runtime. Hegel is on the opposite side. We try to implement a strong type system which will guarantee that your program is valid.

```typescript
const doubles: Array<number> = [Math.PI, Math.E];

// Error: Type "Array<number>" is incompatible with type "Array<number | string>"
const numbersToShow: Array<number | string> = doubles;
numbersToShow.push((42).toString(2));
const rounded = doubles.map((double) => double.toFixed());
```

> The same example in TypeScript (tested at version 3.7.5) will be valid, but uncaught type error will be thrown at runtime [TypeScript Example](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html?ssl=4&ssc=11&pln=4&pc=4#code/MYewdgzgLgBAJiArgIwDYFMIC4YEEBO+AhgJ4A8YiAtsuvgHwwC8MA2gLJFQAWAdAAoBJADQxOPXgFEAugG4AUKEixKNOhAAqIAMrcQAdxwFi5VbXwwAPjGj4AlmADmjFghQYICs+q26DvAAdECG4ACgAWACZeXigdKHsnUMiAShSFAHoMmABVMGAiREduWA0SAPRJQhB8HDc0dFiQADE7AA90OBg7CBgwEFgiGAAzRHyoO3B5eo9eKiIA0Jn0ZkZlptaOuFC02SA).

3. Typed Errors

Hegel implements inference and annotation for functions which gives an ability to understand which error type is inside the catch block and which errors will be, by a function.

```typescript
// Type of "assertIsTrue" function is "(boolean) => undefined throws TypeError"
function assertIsTrue(arg) {
  if (!arg) {
    throw new TypeError("arg is invalid");
  }
}

try {
  assertIsTrue(false);

  // Type of "e" variable is "TypeError | unknown"
} catch (e) {}
```

> The same example in TypeScript (tested at version 3.7.5) will inference e as "any" type [TypeScript Example](http://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html#code/GYVwdgxgLglg9mABAQwM6oKYCcoElUAqWIGAFMlgOYCUiA3gFCLOIzCKkCEFN9TLAqAAsscAO6IwGCQQCeABwwBRLKKykARD1apWYAG7IANjAAmG6v2YBfBrYZQssvgLSYc+IiVLBjmagDcdogQyFAQQhwYtIwCAPRxiHKKiHDsGhgaiIZYMMgARkYYOohaYLIadkA).

### Disadvantages

1. Minimal changes in JavaScript Syntax

TypeScript provides a lot of additional syntax features and syntax sugar with types, but Hegel does not. Hegel is only a JavaScript with types. Let's see the example implemented in TypeScript and Hegel.

```typescript
// TypeScript
enum UserStatus {
  Active,
  Muted,
  Banned,
}

class User {
  constructor(public name: string, public status: UserStatus) {}
}

const Anatoly = new User("Anatoly", UserStatus.Active);
```

```typescript
// Hegel
const UserStatus = Object.freeze({
  Active: "Active",
  Muted: "Muted",
  Banned: "Banned",
});

class User {
  name: string;
  status: $Values<$TypeOf<UserStatus>>;

  constructor(name, status) {
    this.name = name;
    this.status = status;
  }
}

const Anatoly = new User("Anatoly", UserStatus.Active);
```

2. No type coercion and "any" type

As result of attempt to implement soundness type system Hegel doesn't have type coercion and "any" type.

```typescript
// Error: There is no "any" type in Hegel.
const something: any = null;

// Error: Type cast does not exist in Hegel
(null: any).call();
```

## Benefits and disadvantages over Flow.js

If you familiar with Flow.js you may know benefits of static typing, so let's explore benefits and disadvantages of Hegel over Flow.js

### Benefits

1. Better type inference

As example Flow.js docs says: "Flow does not infer generic types. If you want something to have a generic type, annotate it. Otherwise, Flow may infer a type that is less polymorphic than you expect.". It's because Flow.js inference function type by function usage. Hegel inferences function type by function declaration and as result Hegel inferences polymorphic type.

```typescript
// Type of "id" function is "<_a>(_a) => _a"
const id = (x) => x;
// Type of "num" variable is "number"
let num = id(4);
// Type of "str" variable is "string"
let str = id("4");
// Type of "anotherId" variable is "<_a>(_a) => _a"
let anotherId = id(id);
```

> The same example in Flow.js (tested at version 0.119.0) will inference every variable type as union of all applied types [Flow.js Example](https://flow.org/try/#0PQKgBAAgZgNg9gdzCYAoVxhgCoE8AOApmHFGAEQCWAJuWFAK4B2AxgC6VxNiUDOFACiYMAtgCNCAJzAAfMLzaTKTAOaywAgQA8AXGABqAEgCMASjABeAHwHDAJlPnrG4eKnqFS1es27bZyxsjB3JUFi4FHmpLMC1A2IBuDCw8IhIyclc6ADcAQyVcsRhiPgpXCWk5T2U1OV89IwDnYNNQ4rYwVxiaAQAWUyTMHAJiUgpPHPzKQuKefkzRCo9FGp9tBpMnIPtW1Hb5RW7qAXJe8gHk4bSx8lymODYACykASVowPIKikvny9yqVt46ut-FtbCE9oQOncHs9JG8jgIaAMgA).

2. Typed Errors

Hegel implements inference and annotation for functions which gives an ability to understand which error type is inside catch block and which errors will be, by a function.

```typescript
// Type of "assertIsTrue" function is "(boolean) => undefined throws TypeError"
function assertIsTrue(arg) {
  if (!arg) {
    throw new TypeError("arg is invalid");
  }
}

try {
  assertIsTrue(false);
} catch (e) {
  // Type of "e" variable is "TypeError | unknown"
}
```

> The same example in Flow.js (tested at version 0.119.0) will inference e as "empty" type [Flow.js Example](https://flow.org/try/#0PQKgBAAgZgNg9gdzCYAoVUCuA7AxgFwEs5swBDAZwoFMAnfASQoBVbNqAKM2gcwEowAb1RhRYQlDAcAhN35CRYpfgAWtRGGzUkzAJ4AHagFFa62hwBEc8RXHYAbmRiEAJhb6LRAX1Q-U+Wl0FJUoaeiZWdg4oJxo+AG5fMFwyfFwVKWoBYSVgYDA9QzA4SQtqCzBHWkIyACMYahswMoBbfXxdC19UIA).

3. No custom library definition language

Flow.js has custom library definition languages and doesn't support the most popular TypeScript "d.ts" format. But for Hegel TypeScript "d.ts" it is the only way to create the type definition for a library. So, every library which has TypeScript definitions should work with Hegel.

4. No OCaml in source code

[OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) is really great language and this language inspired us to implement the same type inference in Hegel, but the problem is that it's not common language (especially for developer who works with JavaScript stack) and as result it's hard for JavaScript community to contribute into the Flow.js.
We decided to implement Hegel in JavaScript.

### Disadvantages

1. No type coercion and "any" type

As a result of attempting to implement soundness type system Hegel doesn't have type coercion and the "any" type.

```typescript
// Error: There is no "any" type in Hegel.
const something: any = null;

// Error: Type cast does not exist in Hegel
(null: any).call();
```
