# Installation
---------------------

**Step 1**: check your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version:

```bash
$ node -v
v12.0.0
```

Hegel was developed for current LTS version of [Node.js (12.16.1)](https://nodejs.org/en/). So, you need to have at least 12 version.

If you have less than 12 version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) you may change it to 12 or latest by [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

**Step 2**: install `@hegel/cli` with npm globally or locally:

```bash
# globally
$ npm install -g @hegel/cli

# locally
$ npm install -D @hegel/cli
```

**Finally**. You already can use it into your JavaScript project:

```bash
# globally
$ hegel
No errors!

# locally
$ npx hegel
No errors!
```

> Hegel has a zero-configuration, but if you want to change settings see [Configuration Section](https://hegel.js.org/docs/configuration).

## Setup Project

Also you need to setup a compiler which will strip away Hegel types. The same as Flow, you can choose between [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [flow-remove-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flow-remove-types).

### Babel 

```bash
$ npm i -D @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-flow
```

After that you need to create a .babelrc file at the root of your project with next content:

```json
{
  "presets": [["@babel/preset-flow", { "all": true }]]
}
```

Now you can run it manualy:

```bash
$ npx babel directory_with_your_project_files/ -- -d compilation_destination_directory
```

Or you can add script inside your `package.json` `scripts` section:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "babel directory_with_your_project_files/ -d compilation_destination_directory/",
  }
}
```

### Flow Remove Types

Install `flow-remove-types`:
```bash
$ npm i -D flow-remove-types
```

And add next script inside your `package.json` `scripts` section:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "flow-remove-types directory_with_your_project_files/ --out-dir compilation_destination_directory/ --all",
  }
}
```

And run it by:
```bash
$ npm run build
```
