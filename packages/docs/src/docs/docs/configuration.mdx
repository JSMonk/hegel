# Configuration
---------------------

Hegel initially uses default configuration, but if you want to ignore some files inside your project or tell Hegel that you have a specific environment ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for example) then you need to configure Hegel manually.

To eject default configuration run:

```bash
$ hegel init
Project initialized.
```

After the command is executed `.hegelrc` file will be created.

By default `.hegelrc` uses [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format. But you have the ability to choose between YAML and JSON.

The `.hegelrc` consists of 4 sections:

- [environment](#environment)
- [exclude](#exclude)
- [include](#include)
- [typings](#typings)

## environment

String, which defines the specific environment that should be used. For now only "nodejs" and "browser" options exist. By default Hegel  will not include any environment.

```yaml
environment: browser
# or
environment: nodejs
```

## exclude

Array of [glob-pattern strings](https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/usage/parameters/globbing-patterns) that match files to be excluded from analysis. By default Hegel excludes all files in the "node_modules" directory.

```yaml
exclude:
  - ./node_modules/**
  - ./dist/**
  - specific.js
```

## include

Array of [glob-pattern strings](https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com/usage/parameters/globbing-patterns) that match files that should be analyzed. By default Hegel will analyze all files that end in `.js`.

```yaml
include:
  - ./**/*.js
  - ./components/*.jsx
  - specific.mjs
```

## typings

Array of paths where Hegel should search for typings. Order is important because Hegel will try to find typings for specific libraries in the order they are defined. By default Hegel will first look inside the local directory "@types" and then inside "./node_modules/@types".

> If type definitions are placed inside a specific package you should not define this package path inside this configuration section.

```yaml
types:
  - ./@types
  - ./custom-types
  - ./node_modules/@types
  - ./node_modules/custom-types
```

> Hegel will first try to find type definitions in the directories specified in the `types` configuration section. If type definitions are not found Hegel will search the `node_modules` directory. If Hegel can't find type definitions it will infer the types automatically.
