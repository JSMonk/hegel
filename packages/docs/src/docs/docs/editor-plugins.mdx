## Visual Studio Code

Currently, the extension is still in development. So, you can try it only via debug mode.

To run the extension in debug mode you need to:

1. Clone Hegel repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JSMonk/hegel
```

2. Add `hegel/packages/language-server` to your VS code workspace. Do not
   open `hegel` or add `hegel` to your workspace, otherwise "Run and Debug" cannot
   find the `.vscode/launch.json` configuration.

3. Go to the "Run and Debug" section

4. Run "Extension" option
